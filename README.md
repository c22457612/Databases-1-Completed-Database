# Explanation
This project was completed over the course of my databases module in my first semester of 2nd year over a series of labs that I had to complete once a week.
Each lab built off the work of the previous lab until we had a complex functioning database.
lab13.sql is the finalized version of this project and last lab but the other labs show the progression of the project week by week.
We used DBeaver for the database management system.
